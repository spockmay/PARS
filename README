This project is designed to study PAP adherence predictors based on respiratory signal analysis. Breathing irregularity
is predictive of adherence.  We are looking to expand on and develop new models to predict long-term PAP adherence using
analysis of respiratory signals captured from diagnostic sleep studies.

Code documentation is available via sphinx at:
https://spockmay.github.io/PARS/html/index.html

The data from sleep studies is stored in the European Data Format (EDF) files. These are read using
pyEDFlib v0.1.9 <https://github.com/holgern/pyedflib> with a very light wrapper.
